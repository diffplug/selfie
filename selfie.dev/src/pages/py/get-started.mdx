To start snapshot testing in Python, all you need is to add a single dependency.

## Installation

### Requirements

Selfie requires Python 3.9 or newer. It has plugins for the following Python test runners:

- Pytest via [pytest-selfie](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-selfie/).
- PRs welcome for other test runners (see [here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/350) for a guide)

## Quickstart

_If you haven't seen the [GIF on our GitHub](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie), you might want to watch that first (give us a ‚≠ê while you're at it üòâ)._

Here's a basic example of snapshot testing with Selfie:

```python
from selfie_lib import expect_selfie

def test_quickstart():
    expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be([1, 2, 3])
```

## Data Types

Selfie supports various Python data types for snapshot testing:

```python
# Examples from simple_inline_test.py
expect_selfie(20000).to_be(20_000)
expect_selfie([1, 2, 3]).to_be([1, 2, 3])
expect_selfie(("a", 2, 3)).to_be(("a", 2, 3))
expect_selfie({"a": 1, "b": 2}).to_be({"a": 1, "b": 2})
```

## Basic Disk Snapshots

For simple disk snapshots, use `to_match_disk`:

```python
expect_selfie("A").to_match_disk()
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Advanced disk snapshot features are still under development.

## Modes and CI Integration

Selfie has three modes:
- `interactive` (default): Allows snapshot updates
- `readonly`: No snapshots can be written
- `overwrite`: Every snapshot is overwritten

> üöß **Work in Progress**:
> - CI mode examples and integration
> - Advanced disk snapshot features
> - Binary data handling

## Reference

Full API documentation is available at [pydoc.selfie.dev](https://pydoc.selfie.dev).

Currently implemented features:
- Basic snapshot testing with `.to_be()`
- Simple disk snapshots with `.to_match_disk()`
- Support for Python primitive types and collections
- Basic interactive mode

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Some advanced features like CI mode integration and advanced disk snapshots are still under development.

The real power of selfie is asserting on arbitrary objects using **facets**, which are covered in the [advanced section](/py/facets).

_Pull requests to improve the documentation are greatly appreciated, you can find the [source code here](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie)._
