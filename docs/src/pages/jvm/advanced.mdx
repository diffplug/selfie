Diving deeper into Selfie's capabilities, this advanced usage guide will help you leverage the full potential of this robust Java snapshot testing library.

## Configuring snapshot storage

By default, snapshots are stored in a `__snapshots__` directory. However, if you wish to customize this location:

```java
Selfie.configure().setSnapshotDirectory("/custom/directory/path");
```

## Multiple snapshots in a single test

While a common pattern is to have one snapshot per test, you might find yourself needing multiple snapshots in a single test. Name your snapshots for clarity:

```java
Selfie.capture(output1, "snapshotName1");
Selfie.capture(output2, "snapshotName2");
```

## Handling dynamic data

Sometimes, the output may contain dynamic elements, like timestamps or random IDs. You can use matchers to ignore or adapt to these dynamic parts:

```java
Selfie.captureWithMatchers(output, new DynamicDataMatcher("timestamp", "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}"));
```

In this example, the `DynamicDataMatcher` replaces a timestamp with a regular expression ensuring a consistent snapshot.

## Comparing different data types

Selfie isn't limited to just string comparisons. You can compare other data types too:

```java
List<String> outputList = someFunctionThatReturnsAList();
Selfie.capture(outputList);

Map<String, Object> outputMap = anotherFunctionThatReturnsAMap();
Selfie.capture(outputMap);
```

## Interactive snapshot review

In case of a snapshot mismatch, you might want to review the changes interactively:

```java
Selfie.configure().enableInteractiveMode();
```

This will prompt you during test execution, showing you the differences and letting you decide whether to update the snapshot or fail the test.

## Snapshot serializers

For complex objects, you might need to define how the object should be transformed into its snapshot representation:

```java
Selfie.configure().addSerializer(new CustomObjectSerializer());
```

Your `CustomObjectSerializer` should implement Selfie's `Serializer` interface, ensuring consistent string representation for your custom objects.

## Setting snapshot lifetime

If you want your snapshots to have a limited lifetime (for instance, if certain snapshots should be revisited after a month):

```java
Selfie.configure().setSnapshotLifetime(Duration.ofDays(30));
```

Once the lifetime exceeds, the snapshot will be treated as stale, prompting you to either update or validate its continued correctness.

## Ignoring specific fields

For certain objects, you might want to ignore specific fields from snapshot comparisons:

```java
Selfie.capture(outputObject, new IgnoreFieldsMatcher("field1", "field2"));
```

The `IgnoreFieldsMatcher` ensures that the specified fields are not taken into account during snapshot comparisons.

## Custom diff viewers

To get a visual diff when snapshots don't match, integrate a custom diff viewer:

```java
Selfie.configure().setDiffViewer(new CustomDiffViewer());
```

Your `CustomDiffViewer` should implement Selfie's `DiffViewer` interface.
