# Get started

## Installation

### Maven

If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourdomain.selfie</groupId>
    <artifactId>selfie</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace `LATEST_VERSION` with the latest available version of Selfie.

### Gradle

For Gradle users, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
testImplementation 'com.yourdomain.selfie:selfie:LATEST_VERSION'
```

Again, replace `LATEST_VERSION` with the latest available version of Selfie.

## Basic usage

1. **Capture a Snapshot:**

   Before you can use the snapshot testing, you need to capture an initial snapshot. This will be used as a reference for future tests.

   ```java
   import com.yourdomain.selfie.Selfie;

   public class YourTestClass {
       @Test
       public void yourTestMethod() {
           String output = someFunctionThatReturnsAString();
           Selfie.capture(output);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compare with Snapshot:**

   Once you've captured the initial snapshot, subsequent test runs will automatically compare the current output with the saved snapshot.

   ```java
   import com.yourdomain.selfie.Selfie;

   public class YourTestClass {
       @Test
       public void yourTestMethod() {
           String output = someFunctionThatReturnsAString();
           Selfie.assertEqualsWithSnapshot(output);
       }
   }
   ```

   If the output differs from the saved snapshot, `assertEqualsWithSnapshot` will fail, pointing out the differences.

3. **Update a Snapshot:**

   If you made intentional changes to the application output and want to update the snapshot, you can do so with:

   ```java
   Selfie.updateSnapshot(output);
   ```

## Tips and tricks

- **Folder Structure**: By default, Selfie saves snapshots in a directory named `__snapshots__` alongside your test files. Ensure you check this into your version control to keep reference snapshots consistent across different environments.
  
- **Named Snapshots**: You can name your snapshots to make it easier to identify them, especially if you have multiple snapshots in one test class.
